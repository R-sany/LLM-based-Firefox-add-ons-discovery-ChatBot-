# Create an LLM-based Chat AI Firefox Add-ons Discovery Feature

## Project Description
The project aims to leverage the intuitive conversational appeal of chat AI to help Firefox users find the right browser extensions for their distinct needs. Indeed for many Firefox users — especially those unfamiliar with browser extensions — the process of finding an effective, trustworthy extension among tens of thousands of options can be a daunting and seemingly insurmountable challenge. Chat AI presents an opportunity to demystify the add-ons discovery experience. Users will be able to simply explain their browsing problem/issue/desire and the chat tool will find the best Firefox extension solution for them.
